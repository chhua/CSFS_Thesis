Using pressure sensors and I2C temperature and humidity sensor, via stainless steel weights and software algorithms to find the conversion factors of voltage and weight for the five segments then calibrate the pressure sensors. Temperature and humidity sensor calibrate by using a constant temperature and humidity machine. The error of consequence after correcting is within acceptable range. For example, using short arm cast to set on the upper extremity models, and stick pressure sensors on the apophysis of the bone models while temperature and humidity sensor sticking on the middle of the arm for detecting the changing of the data in the process of hot plaster covering. GUI shows the data immediately while backstage saving the data to local light database. Also uploading data to cloud database to supply the users a feedback system of detecting the changing of pressure, temperature or humidity. The highest detecting error of pressure sensors is within 1.5% and the error of temperature is within 2% while 4% of humidity. The results of sensors are in acceptable range that proved the data of detecting is reliable.
